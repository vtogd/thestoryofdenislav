       <h4 style="color:antiquewhite" >To make matters worse, Denislav has no regard for 
        anyone else’s comfort. He blasts his games and anime
         at full volume, completely oblivious to how loud and
          disruptive it is. His mom, clearly exhausted, tries 
          to set boundaries, but every attempt is met with him 
          shouting back as if he’s the one being wronged. And
           the worst part? He just leaves everything where it
            falls. Chip crumbs on the floor, sticky soda cans
             everywhere—he doesn't even care. His desk looks
              like a greasy battlefield, with his mouse and 
              keyboard slick from all the junk food he’s constantly 
              eating while playing. It’s like he’s determined to turn his room into a filthy cave.</h4>
